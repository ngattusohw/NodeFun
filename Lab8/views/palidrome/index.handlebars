  <p> This website takes a simple string input (of a super long sentance, or just a basic word), and checks to see if it is a palidrome! Now what is a palidrome you might ask? Well, it was said best by the spec of this assignment! A palindrome is a phrase that is spelled the same way, backwards and forwards (ignoring spacing and punctuation; only alphanumeric characters matter). So, for example, "Madam" is a palidrome, but sadly, "pizza", is not :( </p>
