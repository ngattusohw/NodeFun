	    <h2>The prelude</h2>
	  	<p>I love to play drums. But I also loved playing soccer. This is why, when I was pulled off of freshman soccer try-outs to go to the first day of percussion camp at the Point Pleasant Borough High School's marching band, I was extremely conflicted. When I got there, at the time I was positive that I was making the correct choice of dropping my 9 year passion of soccer, for my other, equally as loved passion of drumming. However, as time went on, that desicion became one to haunt me for the rest of my high school career. Dun dun dun!</p>

	    <h2> The meat </h2>
	    <p> I worked my butt off every second that I was at jazz band. Why? Because I loved to play drums, and the people there were super inviting and cool to hang out with. As a freshman, I was immediatey brought in by the seniors. However, as time went on, and the upperclassmen started to graduate, I was left alone and without friends within the band. Throughout the remaining years of band, it started to become more corrupt. The few friends I had left got promoted to positions of power, and often abused that power. So, I decided to quit my senior year, and join soccer for my senior year of highschool.
